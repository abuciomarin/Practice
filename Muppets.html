    <h1>The Muppets</h1>
    <p>Created by Jim Henson in 1955,The Muppets are an American ensemble cast of puppet characters known for an absurdist, burlesque, 
        and self-referential style of variety-sketch comedy. Kermit is known as the leader. Kermit possesses a natural sense of 
        leadership within the Muppets, explaining that "he has all these zany characters and a world around him and he tries to be the 
        center and hold everything together...sometimes he gets too much and blows his top, but essentially he kind of goes with the flow."
